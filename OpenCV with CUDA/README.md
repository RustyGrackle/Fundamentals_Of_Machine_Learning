* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/OpenCV%20with%20CUDA/Vehicle-Car-detection-in-real-time">Vehicle Detection Using OpenCV</a> : Vehicle detection is one of the widely used features by companies and organizations these days. This technology uses computer vision to detect different types of vehicles in a video or real-time via a camera. In this project, we have used `OpenCV` to detect the vehicles on the highway.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/OpenCV%20with%20CUDA/DriverDrowsiness">Driver Drowsiness Detection</a> : The objective of this Python project is `to build a drowsiness detection system` that will `detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed` for a few seconds.
