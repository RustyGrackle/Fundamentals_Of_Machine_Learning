# Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning
This repository is made so to provide clear depth in the fundamentals of Machine Learning.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Back_Propagation_and_Creating_Neuron_Layers_MLP.ipynb">Back_Propagation_and_Creating_Neuron_Layers_MLP</a> : In this we have created Backpropagation from scratch and created Neuron, layers, Multi-layer Perceptron from scratch (A mini version of `Pytorch` library from scratch).
* <a href= "https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Image_Classification_Using_Keras.ipynb">Image_Classification_Using_Keras</a> : In this, we have used `Fashion MNIST` dataset to do multi-classification.

href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/BigramLanguageModelling.ipynb">BigramLanguageModelling</a> : In this notebook, we have made `Bigram language modelling` from scratch, and then build `Neural Network` using `Pytorch`, which does the same job as `Bigram model`. we have used total `32033` words to model this.
