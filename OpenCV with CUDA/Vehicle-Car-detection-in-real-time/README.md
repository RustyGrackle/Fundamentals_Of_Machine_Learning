# Vehicle Detection

Vehicle detection is one of the widely used features by companies and organizations these days. This technology uses computer vision to detect different types of vehicles in a video or real-time via a camera. It finds its applications in traffic control, car tracking, creating parking sensors and many more.

In this project, we will learn how to build a car tracking system in python for both recorded and live cam streamed videos.

Use Cases
1.	Sensors at parking stations can identify defaulters
2.	Detecting the speed of cars
3.	Identify defaulters who speed up the car while pedestrians cross the road
