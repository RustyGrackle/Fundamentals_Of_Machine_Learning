# OpenCV with CUDA and `COMPUTER VISION`

* This Directory is for topics and projects related to `OpenCV` with `CUDA`.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/OpenCV%20with%20CUDA/Vehicle-Car-detection-in-real-time">Vehicle Detection Using OpenCV</a> : Vehicle detection is one of the widely used features by companies and organizations these days. This technology uses computer vision to detect different types of vehicles in a video or real-time via a camera. In this project, we have used `OpenCV` to detect the vehicles on the highway.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/OpenCV%20with%20CUDA/DriverDrowsiness">Driver Drowsiness Detection</a> : The objective of this Python project is `to build a drowsiness detection system` that will `detect that a person’s eyes are closed` for a few seconds.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/OpenCV%20with%20CUDA/FaceRecognition_usingOpenCVand_Python">Face Recognition Using OpenCV</a> : In this project, `OpenCV` uses `machine learning algorithms to search for faces` within a picture. Because faces are so complicated, there isn’t one simple test that will tell you if it found a face or not. Instead, there are thousands of small patterns and features that must be matched. The `algorithms break the task of identifying the face into thousands of smaller, bite-sized tasks`, each of which is easy to solve. `These tasks are also called classifiers`.
