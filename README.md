# Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning
This repository is made so to provide clear depth in the fundamentals of Machine Learning.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Back_Propagation_and_Creating_Neuron_Layers_MLP.ipynb">Back Propagation and Creating Neuron, Layers, MLP</a> : In this we have created `Backpropagation Algorithm` from scratch and created `Neuron`, `layers`, `Multi-layer Perceptron` from scratch (A `mini version` of `Pytorch library` from scratch).

* <a
href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/BigramLanguageModelling.ipynb">Bigram Language Modelling</a> : In this notebook, we have made `Bigram character level language model` from scratch, and then build `Neural Network` using `Pytorch`, which does the same job as `Bigram model`. we have used total `32033` words to model this.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/CNN_ComputerVision">CNN And Computer Vision</a> : This Directory contains `concepts of CNN`, `Binary Classification Model Using CNN`, `Multiple Classification Model Using CNN` with `TensorFlow`.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/OpenCV%20with%20CUDA">OpenCV with CUDA<a> : This Directory contains projects related to `Computer Vision` and use of `OpenCV` with Parallel Computing platform - `CUDA`.

* <a href= "https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Image_Classification_Using_Keras.ipynb">Image Classification Using Keras</a> : In this, we have used `Fashion MNIST` dataset to do multi-classification.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Determinants_of_Earnings.ipynb">Determinants of Earnings</a> : In this, I have used and get experienced with libraries `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` and build a simple `linear regression` and `Multivariable Regression` model to predict earnings according to the features - years of schooling and years of work experience.
