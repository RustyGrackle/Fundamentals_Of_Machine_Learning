Vehicle detection is one of the widely used features by companies and organizations these days. This technology uses computer vision to detect different types of vehicles in a video or real-time via a camera. It finds its applications in traffic control, car tracking, creating parking sensors and many more.

In this project, we will learn how to build a car tracking system in python for both recorded and live cam streamed videos.

Before we begin, we need to install the OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library which is built to help developers carry out tasks related to computer vision using command:

pip install opencv-python

Let us now build the system in Python
We have the required libraries installed. The way the technology works is that we train the model on various image parameters of the object to be detected (car in this case), which is used to identify the object in our target.
Think of it as the train and test datasets of any machine learning model.

In this case:
Train dataset: .xml files which capture the image details of the target object
Test dataset: Live stream video/ Recorded video

Result:-
Hurray! You have successfully built a setup which detects cars in real-time and in video recordings.

Use Cases
1.	Sensors at parking stations can identify defaulters
2.	Detecting the speed of cars
3.	Identify defaulters who speed up the car while pedestrians cross the road
