# Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning
This repository is made so to provide clear depth in the fundamentals of Machine Learning.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Makemore">Project: Makemore</a> : In this project: `makemore`, It `takes one text file as input`, where each line is assumed to be one training thing, and `generates more things like it`. To create this project, I implemented various models i.e. `Bigram Model`, `MLP Model`, `CNN Model`, `RNN Model`, `LSTM Model`, `GRU Model`, `Transformer Model`, and evaluated their accuracy, `Transformers` are performing best for now. Libraries used are `Pytorch`, `matplotlib`.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/CNN_ComputerVision">CNN And Computer Vision</a> : This Directory contains `concepts of CNN`, `Binary Classification Model Using CNN`, `Multiple Classification Model Using CNN` with `TensorFlow`.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/tree/main/OpenCV%20with%20CUDA">OpenCV with CUDA<a> : This Directory contains projects related to `Computer Vision` and use of `OpenCV` with Parallel Computing platform - `CUDA`.

* <a href= "https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Image_Classification_Using_Keras.ipynb">Image Classification Using Keras</a> : In this, This model used `Fashion MNIST` dataset to do `Multi-Classification`.

* <a href="https://github.com/RustyGrackle/Fundamentals_Of_Machine_Learning/blob/main/Determinants_of_Earnings.ipynb">Determinants of Earnings</a> : In this, I have used and get experienced with libraries `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` and build a simple `linear regression` and `Multivariable Regression` model to predict earnings according to the features - years of schooling and years of work experience.
