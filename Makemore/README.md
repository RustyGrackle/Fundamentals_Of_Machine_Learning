# PROJECT: Makemore

* `makemore` takes one text file as input, where each line is assumed to be one training thing, and generates more things like it.
* It is `an autoregressive character-level language model`, with a wide choice of `models from bigrams, MLP all the way to a Transformer` (exactly as seen in GPT), used library `Pytorch`.
